          MonPlan was originally an Open Source course planning tool, until
          Monash University approached us and asked us if we would build the
          tool with them. Over the course of two years, we have delivered
          various other projects and have transformed how the university fosters
          and grows student innovation.{' '}
        </p>
        <p>
          MonPlan was rolled out as an Enterprise solution in October 2018, and
          has been incorporated within course advice, course planning and other
          key enrolment processes across the university.
